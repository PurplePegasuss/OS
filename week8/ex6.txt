My solution to the problem:

N_pages = total amount of bits to be filled / total amount of bits can be hold by one page.

As we have 16 bit virtual addresses, we need to store up to 2^16 addresses.
As we also have 8 Kb (not KB by the way) per page we can store 8 * 1024 * 1024 = 2^13 (b) per page.

Thus, we have:
N = 2^16 b / 2 ^13 b = 2^3 = 8 

Answer: 8 pages.
