A physical address is a real binary address attached to a part of physical memory. 
A virtual address is a binary address attached to a part of virtual memory. 
It is (usually) written in the program code and mapped to physical memory with the help of MMU.
Virtual address memory space may cover more address spaces than a physical one, as it solves the problem of physical memory limitation.
